# Don't Forget

Rather bare-bone CRUD application with Express.js, MongoDB and vanilla JavaScript on the client side.

## Running the app

Make sure you have MongoDB and Node.js installed.

Then, install packages:

`npm install`

Run the app:

`npm run dev`

Open in your browser:

http://localhost:3000/

## Todo

- Make the app ready for deployment
- Deploy the app (probably to Heroku)
